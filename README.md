Elegoo Satellite settings

Here are my support settings for Elegoo Satellite. They are of the EVO (smart script) type. There are 3 settings.

GroundControl - These are anchor supports with a 0.400mm tip and a 1.200mm diameter support. They are meant to be placed manually, although you can try auto-generating the supports for models like bases. No raft/baseboard will be generated.

LowOrbit - This is a low density support script meant to be used on models with large, flat surfaces, such as bases and vehicles/vehicle parts. A raft/baseboard will be generated.

HighOrbit - This is a high density support script meant to be used on models that are figures, such as tabletop gaming miniatures. A raft/baseboard will be generated.

Both LowOrbit and HighOrbit have the same tip size (0.250mm), but LowOrbit has a thicker diameter support (0.900mm), while HighOrbit is thinner (0.800mm).
